  <h1>Because of Them. Through You.</h1>

  <p>
    Our parents always struggled raising us,<br>
    but they never wanted us to feel<br>
    that we were missing anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    When they were no longer here,<br>
    <strong>you continued everything they started.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    You stood tall — for both of us.
  </p>

  <p>🕯️ Their teachings live on through you.</p>
