  <h3>My Hero. My Bhaiya.</h3>
  <p>
    You are not just my elder brother.<br>
    You are my strength.
  </p>
  <p>
    After everything we lost,<br>
    you became my wall — strong, silent, unbreakable.
  </p>
  <p>
    You took every responsibility on yourself,<br>
    without ever letting me feel weak.
  </p>
  <p class="highlight">
    For me, you are my hero<br>
    and my inspiration.

  <h3>Because of Them. Through You.</h3>
  <p>
    Our parents always struggled raising us,<br>
    but they never wanted us to feel<br>
    that we were missing anything.
  </p>
  <p>
    They gave us values, strength, and love —<br>
    even in hardship.
  </p>
  <p>
    When they were no longer here,<br>
    <strong>you continued everything they started.</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="soft">
    You didn’t complain.<br>
    You didn’t step back.<br>
    You stood tall — for both of us.
  </p>
  <p class="tribute">🕯️ Their teachings live on through you.<br>They would be proud of you.</p>
